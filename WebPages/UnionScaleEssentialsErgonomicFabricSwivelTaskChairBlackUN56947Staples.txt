The tilt ratio is 1:1; so for every one inch you lean back, the front edge of the seat comes up one inch. Yes Chair Synchro Tilt Chairs with the synchro-tilt mechanism consist of a back and seat that move together in a 2-to-1 ratio. This means that for every two degrees that the back reclines, the seat will tilt back one degree. This allows the user’s feet to remain on the floor as they recline. No Ergonomic Ergonomic Locking-Tilt Represents upright tilt lock Yes Multi-Tilter The backrest and seat pan on a chair tilt independently of each other.
