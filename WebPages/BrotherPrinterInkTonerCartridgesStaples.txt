Known for its exceptional quality and best-in-class printing, Brother printers are great for home, office, and industrial applications. When it’s time to change the ink or toner cartridge in your Brother printer, it’s important to know which type you’ll need for your specific model. Ink cartridges and toner cartridges are often thought of as interchangeable, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Both Brother ink and toner cartridges have specific applications that are designed to keep their respective printers working smoothly for years. Let’s dive into the specifics of Brother printer ink and toner cartridges and which you should get for your printer. Why Buy Brother Printer Ink or Toner Cartridges? Both Brother printer ink and toner cartridges are high-quality products designed to produce professional-level documents. Printer ink and toner cartridges are available in standard, high-yield, extra high-yield, or ultra high-yield capacities. A higher-yield Brother cartridge contains more ink or toner, meaning that it can handle any print job that you have ahead of you. When which type of printer and ink or toner, it’s important to understand the differences in benefits and features between the two products. Brother Toner Cartridges Brother toner cartridges are made for Brother laser printers which are mostly known for their ability to produce high-quality documents and photos at a very high speed. For this reason, toner cartridges are often preferred for office use. However, a Brother toner cartridge can also be useful for a home office. Toner is also a good option for people who print on a semi-regular basis, as toner is made of a powder and can last for years at a time when properly stored. Toner can also be purchased in multi-packs, which can help cut down on time and costs when compared with a single-toner package. Brother Ink Cartridges Brother ink cartridges are made for Brother inkjet printers. Brother ink is known for producing extremely colorful and fade-resistant documents. With these ink cartridges, you can easily create a beautiful picture to celebrate a special day, or provide top-quality work for a client. Brother printer ink is ideal for photographers, artists, or any individual that needs to produce images that are crisp and sharp, or photos with vivid colors.

The actual number of page yield will vary depending on the toner/ink coverage of the documents, the number of pages per job and the paper size. Page yield is based on an approximate 5% page coverage. ISO page yield is a reliable way to compare products from competing manufacturers, since all tests are subjected to the same set of ISO testing standards. Valid online at staples.com® only.
