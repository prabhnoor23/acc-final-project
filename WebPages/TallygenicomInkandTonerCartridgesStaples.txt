These products are engineered to provide consistent toner delivery, so every printed page is crisp and sharp. Unlike compatible toner cartridges, TallyGenicom toner cartridges are manufactured using the same tough criteria as TallyGenicom printers. Convenient Cartridge Packaging Staples offers TallyGenicom cartridges in both standard- and high-yield formats. Standard-yield products are ideal for homes or small offices with moderate print needs, and they reduce the upfront costs of purchasing toner. High-yield TallyGenicom printer cartridges are an excellent choice for businesses or work groups that do a lot of printing, since their larger capacity reduces downtime for cartridge replacement and minimizes per-page printing costs. All TallyGenicom toner cartridges are individually packaged, making it easy to buy toner as needed or store a spare or two for periods of high demand. Simple Installation Unlike many remanufactured toner cartridges, TallyGenicom toner cartridges feature a drop-in, spill-resistant design that's easy to install and won't create a mess. Anyone in the office can replace these cartridges, so office staff aren't slowed by a printer that's out of service. Exceptional Print Performance TallyGenicom printer cartridges use toners that are formulated to provide full-page coverage and consistent black-and-white or color output, so every printed page is clean and professional looking. Compatible toner cartridges from third-party manufacturers sometimes use recycled parts that may affect output. TallyGenicom toner cartridges are stringently tested to ensure they meet or exceed their technical specifications. These OEM products create high-quality output, even when used in legacy printers. Use genuine TallyGenicom printer cartridges and be sure every printed page produced is crisp and sharp. While third-party compatible toner cartridges may appear to be a bargain, OEM cartridges, which use higher-quality parts and toner, are often the better deal in the long run. TallyGenicom toner cartridges are also available in both standard- and high-yield formats, making it easy to find one with the capacity that's right for your office. Compuprint Disclaimer Page yield is the estimated number of pages that can be printed with a printer cartridge. The actual number of page yield will vary depending on the toner/ink coverage of the documents, the number of pages per job and the paper size. Page yield is based on an approximate 5% page coverage. ISO page yield is a reliable way to compare products from competing manufacturers, since all tests are subjected to the same set of ISO testing standards. 7/16/23 – 7/22/23 50% BIR on TONER & DRUMS Valid online at staples.com® only.
