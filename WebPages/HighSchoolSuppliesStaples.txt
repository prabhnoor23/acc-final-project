From classes and homework to after-school activities and socializing, there's a lot to keep track of. A well-stocked supply closet can help make the school year a little bit easier. Here are some essential supplies for high school students and teachers. High School Writing Supplies 101 Highlighters are a must-have for any student. They're great for helping to identify key information in textbooks and notes. Teacher-approved brands like Sharpie Highlighters are non-toxic and won't bleed through paper, so they're perfect for use in class and at home. Pens are another important back-to-school supply. Students will need pens for taking notes, writing essays, and completing tests. Look for pens that are comfortable to hold and write smoothly. Ballpoint pens are a good all-purpose option, while gel pens are perfect for adding a pop of color to notes and papers. Markers are another necessity for high school students. They can be used for everything from coloring in maps and diagrams to underlining valuable information in textbooks. Fine-tip markers like Sharpie Pens are ideal for taking notes, while chisel-tip markers are perfect for larger projects. Paper too! Paper is another essential supplies for high school students and teachers. Students will need paper for taking notes, writing essays, and printing out assignments. Look for printer paper that is compatible with your home printer. For more specialized projects, consider investing in cardstock or construction paper.

Be sure to stock up on essentials like highlighters, pens, markers, and paper before heading back to school.
