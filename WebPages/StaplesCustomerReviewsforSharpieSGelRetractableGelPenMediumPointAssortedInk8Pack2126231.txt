Staff 0up votes 0 0down votes 0 Report Staples Customer Verified Buyer Posted Apr 6, 2023 My go to pen The Sharpie pens are great to keep my work looking professional. No smearing on paper documents. I can sign and scan documents without having to clean my printer glass and do not have to rescan docs because of black streaks. I am sold on Sharpie pens. 0up votes 0 0down votes 0 Report Staples Customer Verified Buyer Posted Apr 3, 2023 Forget the Assortment! These are the best pens! I needed a few different colors and ordered the assorted pack. The green and purple pens are not writing properly. The cartridge looks to be filled of ink, but they are both skipping! I do not know if they are old stock or what is going on, but that was a waste of money! 0up votes 0 0down votes 0 Report TIM K.
