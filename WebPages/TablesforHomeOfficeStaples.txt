Learn more about the selection of tables Staples offers below. What Space Do You Need a Table for? Staples has table options for office, home and event spaces. Before purchasing a table, check the dimensions of the space you’ll be using it in, as well as the dimensions of the table. Ensure the size of the table is right for your space. Also consider how many people will be seated at your table and the load it will need to be able to bear. When deciding on how many tables you need when seating a lot of people, a good rule of thumb is to designate around 18 inches of table space per person. Which Office Table Is Best for You? Staples has several options for office tables, including: Conference Room Tables - Choose from rectangular, square or circular tables in a variety of sizes with a professional look. Training Room Tables - Staples’s training room tables are designed to make hands-on application easier and can generally seat one to four people. Drafting Tables - Drafting tables come with a sturdy, inclined design and ample workspace for illustrators. Folding Tables - Choose from small or large folding tables that can be used as a desk when needed and then easily tucked away. Reception Tables - Spruce up reception areas with a stylish reception table. These tables come in a variety of shapes, styles and sizes. What Table Is Best for Your Home? Staples also has a large selection of tables for home use, including: Activity Tables - Activity tables make homework or craft time comfortable while providing adequate tabletop space. Accent and Coffee Tables - Whether you want rectangular or circular, large or small, drawers or no drawers, Staples carries a variety of coffee accent tables to choose from. End Tables - End tables add convenience and functionality to your living room or bedroom, or anywhere in your home you could use added storage and surface space. Table Sets - Looking for matching tables? We’ve got you covered with affordable table sets. What Functionality Does Your Table Need? Consider the functionality you’ll need from your table. Do you prefer to sit at your table, or would a standing option be better if you’re using it for office needs? Do you need a lightweight table for easy moving, or a folding option so it can be tucked away? Assess how durable the table needs to be, the look and size that are right for the space, and whether the surface is stain-resistant to make cleanup easier, such as with hospitality and cafeteria tables. Table Material Options The material your table is made of is also important. Review aspects of each below. Wood - Wooden tables are durable and sturdy and can have a more professional appearance, though they are heavier and more difficult to move. Glass - Glass tables add sophistication to a space and appear to take up less room, making them popular in small areas. However, there is the risk of breakage and the issue of fingerprints. Plastic - Plastic tables hold up well over time and are easier to clean. They’re also more economical. They are often the most basic in their design, though, and don’t always have the same professional appearance as wood or glass. Aluminum - Aluminum tables show off your design tastes and make a statement. They’re incredibly durable and can bear heavy loads, but they are difficult to move.
