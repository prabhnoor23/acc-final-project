One of Canon’s most popular products is long-lasting ink cartridges that are compatible with Canon printers. Learn more about what sets Canon printer ink cartridges apart and how to select the right one for your needs below. What Is Canon Printer Ink? Canon printer ink is specially made ink for Canon printers. The Canon brand makes both ink cartridges and toner cartridges. Ink cartridges are filled with liquid ink that is stored in single containers and is compatible with most Canon inkjet printers. Toner cartridges on the other hand are containers that hold powder, as opposed to liquid, that is then transferred to the paper with laser technology. Canon toner cartridges are often used in Canon laser printers. What Are the Best Features of Canon Printer Ink? Canon printer ink is known for features like great quality and vivid ink colors. Canon ink comes in a variety of beautiful colors, including black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. Canon printer ink is long-lasting, quick-drying, fade-resistant, and virtually smudge-free on both matte and glossy printing surfaces. It also prints clear, crisp letters and images thanks to specific engineering to the cartridge’s nozzle that aids in printing details with added sharpess. If you are printing pictures, Canon ink works best when combined with Canon photo paper. Canon ink is also designed and manufactured in Japan for total quality assurance. Which Canon Ink Cartridges Should You Purchase? There are many ink cartridges to choose from. The first thing to consider when purchasing ink for a Canon printer is if it is compatible with your printer model. Every Canon ink product will list its printer compatibility in the description, so be sure to note the model number before purchasing ink. The amount of ink you want should also be considered. Canon printer ink is available in high-yield options that contain more ink per cartridge, as well as standard-yield options that contain an average amount of ink. The high-yield cartridges are more economical and convenient in the long run, saving you time and money. Canon printer ink is also available in individual cartridges or as a variety pack, which often provides a better deal to save money. No matter which Canon ink or toner cartridges you buy, you can rest assured that you will have beautifully printed documents and images.

The actual number of page yield will vary depending on the toner/ink coverage of the documents, the number of pages per job and the paper size. Page yield is based on an approximate 5% page coverage. ISO page yield is a reliable way to compare products from competing manufacturers, since all tests are subjected to the same set of ISO testing standards. Valid online at staples.com® only.
