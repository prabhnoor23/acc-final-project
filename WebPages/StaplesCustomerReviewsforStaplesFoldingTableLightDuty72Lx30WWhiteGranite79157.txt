I use it to fold laundry, use it as an extension to my work desk at home, outside picnics, home projects. All in all I do not regret getting this table. Also, easy to carry.

Verified Buyer Posted Jun 28, 2023 I bought the table to use for my book launching but since my purchase I have postponed. I opened a table while in staples and I believe it's the right fit.

Best tables ever. Easy to store. Thought the price was too high. I have 7 of them and they never paid more than 49.99. Of course I have had them for 22 years.
