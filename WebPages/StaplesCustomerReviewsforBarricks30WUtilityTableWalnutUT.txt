This is a nice table and as advertised. Easy to put together. One leg was a bit bent on the end so the plug was hard to insert, but it went mostly. Not a noticeable problem. For the price it is a good buy. We are using as a television stand in our break room. 1up votes 1 0down votes 0 Report This website is intended for personal use by US residents only.
