Read full review VS Most helpful critical review Posted Jul 26, 2022 Turns Skin Yellow My son had the desk a day before it started to turn his skin yellow. You can see the slight wearing if where his wrists were sitting on the edge of the desk. Horrible! Who knows what kind of dyes are being used on the piece!

I am in the process of dismantling my current desk, so, I didn't see the crack until just now. I hope that the 15 day return policy is still in force so I can get an exchange. 0up votes 0 0down votes 0 Report Barbara C. Verified Buyer Reviewed at: Staples Advantage Posted Jul 6, 2023 Lovely Desk This is a lovely desk, fits nicely in the area I wanted to use it in. The top is large enough for a monitor and printer. 0up votes 0 0down votes 0 Report Brooke B. Verified Buyer Posted Jul 5, 2023 Solid Desk Questionable Construction This desk fits the aesthetic I was looking for personally. Very heavy, you'll probably need 2 people for lifting it and some of the assembly steps. It comes with 5 part that are very solid but the hardware is cheap plastic. I broke 2 Cam Locks that hold the back plate on so it doesn't look the best but still works as a desk. 0up votes 0 0down votes 0 Report CATHY S.

Finally, a desk that came with the top and drawers already pre-assembled, it was amazing! We had it together and upstairs within 30 minutes.
