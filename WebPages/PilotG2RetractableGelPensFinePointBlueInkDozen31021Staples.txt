These pens work smoothly and consistently, making your employees happy. They also boast long-lasting ink for fewer pen replacements, making the business happy as well.Gel Ink Provides a Smooth, Professional Writing ExperienceNothing's more annoying than a pen that chooses to quit at the vital moment, be it signing a business contract or finally finishing the rest of your crossword puzzle. Even worse is a pen that fades in and out as you use it, resulting in a scrawl that looks like a child did it. Pilot G2 retractable gel pens provide a smooth, flawless writing experience that keeps your business looking professional and minimizes the chance of employees throwing their pens across the room in frustration. Furthermore, the all-purpose blue ink lends credibility to all your documents.Fine Tips Allow for Delicate WorkFor those documents that have limited space or require small penmanship, this gel pen boasts a fine tip. It allows employees to do delicate work, like neatly signing their names in the 1-inch square space available or cramming some more comments onto the sticky notes attached to the break room refrigerator.Long-Lasting Ink Keeps Going and GoingThe ink, like the Energizer Bunny, keeps going and going, meaning that employees can use it as their go-to writing utensil in all their writing, and break room, needs. When the ink finally does run out, the pens are refillable, ultimately saving the company money and being friendly to the Earth.Smooth Grips Reduce Hand FatigueAlthough the ink keeps going, sometimes hands do not. Luckily, the smooth grip relaxes the hand and reduces hand fatigue, enabling employees to work more efficiently.
