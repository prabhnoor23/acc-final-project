Find what will keep your employees and customers safe, from wearable items like face masks & respirators and hearing protection to safety signs and fire protection equipment. Ensure that potential hazards are accounted for and that the proper protections and gear are on-site and ready to go in case of disaster. Personal Protective Equipment Failing to plan is planning to fail, or so the saying goes. Don't skimp on personal protection; stock up on the essentials to keep you and your workforce safe, including face masks & respirators, eye protection, ear protection, head & face protection, footwear & shoe covers and fall protection. Glove & Hand Protection Whether you work in food service, on a job site or outdoors, protecting your hands from danger should be top of mind. Find gloves for every need; whether you're looking for high-quality disposable gloves or heavy-duty work gloves, make time to keep your digits safe from harm. Safety Signs Safety signs are essential to warn and inform those within a workspace, factory, store or other public space of potential hazards. They communicate information quickly and clearly so people can make well-informed decisions about how to act in any given environment. Equip your parking area with traffic signs, use caution tape to secure an area with dangerous spills and stay OSHA-compliant with custom health and safety signage so your people know how to respond in an emergency. First Aid & Wound Care Stay stocked and ready for everyday wounds and ills that might befall your workplace with first aid kits, bandages and over-the-counter medicines, including cold, flu and allergy relief. Having the essentials on hand is a lifesaver when you have a headache or an unfortunate fall. Fire Protection If an emergency occurs in the workplace, having the proper emergency response supplies can be a lifesaver. Emergency response items such as fire extinguishers and smoke alarms & CO detectors alert workers and, in some cases, the authorities to dangerous situations that might arise. Keep these essential supplies properly powered up to ensure you're prepared for all eventualities.
