Paper packing filler is a good choice for lightweight packages or packages that do not need a high level of protection. Foam packing filler is a good choice for medium-weight packages or packages that need a higher level of protection. Plastic packing filler is a good choice for heavyweight packages or packages that need a very high level of protection. What is void fill? Void fill, or packing filler, is a packing material that is used to fill empty spaces in packages. It helps to protect the contents of the package and can also help to prevent damage during shipping. Void fill can be made from a variety of materials, including paper, foam, or plastic. Why do I need void fill? Using a packing filler is important for two main reasons: protection and stability. First, a packing filler helps to protect the contents of your package from damage. It acts as a buffer between the contents and the outside world, absorbing shocks and preventing scratches. Second, void fill helps to keep your packed shipping boxes stable during shipping, storage, or while moving. It prevents shifting and helps to keep the contents of the package in place. What are the different types of void fill? There are three main types of void fill: paper, foam, and plastic. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. Paper is the least expensive option, but it is also the least durable. Paper void fill can be made from recycled materials, making it a good choice for those who are environmentally conscious. However, paper void fill is not as effective at absorbing shocks as foam or plastic packing filler options. By contrast, foam void fill is more expensive than paper void fill, but it is also more durable. Foam packing filler can be made from a variety of materials, including polystyrene, polyurethane, and expanded polypropylene. Foam void fill is effective at absorbing shocks and protecting the contents of your package, but it is not reusable. Plastic void fill is the most expensive packing filler option, but it is also the most durable. Plastic void, such as packing peanuts or bubble rolls, can be made from a variety of materials, including polyethylene, polypropylene, and expanded polystyrene, which are all very effective at absorbing shocks and protecting the contents of your package, and it can be reused in most cases.
