Enjoy a relaxing massage in the privacy of your own office with this incredibly comfortable LeatherSoft upholstered massaging executive office chair. The included remote has a variable slider intensity mode to get to your desired comfort level and has a designated side pocket when not in use. LeatherSoft is leather and polyurethane for added softness and durability. Finding a comfortable chair is essential when sitting for long periods at a time. Having the support of an ergonomic office chair may help promote good posture and reduce future back problems or pain. Mid-back office chairs offer support to the mid-to-upper back region. The waterfall front seat edge removes pressure from the lower legs and improves circulation. Chair easily swivels 360 degrees to get the maximum use of your workspace without strain. The pneumatic adjustment lever will allow you to easily adjust the seat to your desired height.

The tilt ratio is 1:1; so for every one inch you lean back, the front edge of the seat comes up one inch. No Chair Lumbar Support Fixed Chair Synchro Tilt Chairs with the synchro-tilt mechanism consist of a back and seat that move together in a 2-to-1 ratio. This means that for every two degrees that the back reclines, the seat will tilt back one degree. This allows the user’s feet to remain on the floor as they recline. No Ergonomic Ergonomic Recline Ability to change the position of the back to a leaning position. No Recline Seat Glide No Swivel A chair whose seat can be turned around to face in a different direction without moving the legs.
