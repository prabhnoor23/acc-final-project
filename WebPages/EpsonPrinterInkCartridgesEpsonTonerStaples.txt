For example, if you have an Epson printer, it is recommended to use Epson brand printer ink when you need a replacement cartridge. Epson printer inks are high quality and long-lasting, making them an excellent option for printing your upcoming photos, documents, and reports. Why Should I Buy Epson Printer Ink? You should consider buying Epson toner and ink cartridges for a variety of reasons. First, this ink is made to work especially well with Epson printers, so printing performance can be better with Epson ink cartridges compared to generic cartridges. Second, Epson ink cartridges are known for their vibrant ink colors that make every picture and image beautiful and life-like. Printed projects for school, reports for work, or pictures for friends and family will look amazing with Epson printer ink. Epson ink cartridges are also fast-drying, making every print touchable and usable right after printing. This ink is also long-lasting so that important documents and beautiful printed memories will last a lifetime. This longevity is especially important if you are planning on printing photos for a family scrapbook. If you’re planning on going this route, we recommend pairing your Epson printer ink with Epson Photo Paper. Together, these two create professional quality photo prints that you’ll love for years to come. Which Epson Printer Ink Should I Purchase? There are a variety of Epson printer ink cartridges to choose from, so you’ll need to take a few things into consideration before you buy. The first thing to think about is if it is compatible with your printer model. Every Epson ink product will list its printer compatibility in the description, so make sure to note which printer model you have before shopping. The amount of ink you want and the colors you need should also be considered. Epson printer ink is available in a variety of vivid colors including black, cyan, magenta, and yellow. If you are printing a lot of text documents and reports, you should consider getting more black ink than any other color. If you are printing many bright pictures and images, we recommend getting a mixture of the other colors. Epson printer ink is sold in high-yield, extra high-yield, and standard ink options. The higher the yield, the more prints you can get out of a single cartridge. So, if you print a fair amount, opt for a higher yield. Additionally, Epson printer ink is sold in individual cartridges or as a combination pack, which often allows shoppers to save money.

The actual number of page yield will vary depending on the toner/ink coverage of the documents, the number of pages per job and the paper size. Page yield is based on an approximate 5% page coverage. ISO page yield is a reliable way to compare products from competing manufacturers, since all tests are subjected to the same set of ISO testing standards. Valid online at staples.com® only.
