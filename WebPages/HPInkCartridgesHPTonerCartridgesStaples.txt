HP ink and toner products are made from advanced chemical formulas to provide vivid colors and crisp text, so all your documents look professional. Plus, they come with the assurance that they will work flawlessly with your compatible model of HP printer. Why HP ink and HP toner? If you are looking to replace ink or toner for your HP printer, opting for brand-coordinating cartridges has several advantages. HP toner and ink will ensure you maintain the same level of quality, resulting in less reprints and, ultimately, less waste. As a top brand in printers and cartridges, consider HP for their: Quality - HP inks are known for consistently printing documents, photos and more in high-quality. Sustainability - Take advantage of the free and easy cartridge recycling program offered by HP, which makes a point to use recycled materials in manufacturing. Indoor Air Quality - HP toner and HP ink are known for their odorless and low-emission printing because they meet stringent eco-label emissions criteria. What kind of cartridge should I use? When using non-manufacturer toner brands, you may experience a number of problems, including poor print quality, more reprints, fewer quality prints, poor reliability, printer damage, printer downtime and more printer service. That's why we recommend using HP toner and ink with HP brand printers. HP toners and inks are specifically designed to deliver supreme quality and consistency in printing from compatible HP printers. You can locate the cartridge type your printer requires in the unit's manual or visit Staples.com to enter your model number into our Ink & Toner Finder, and we'll show you exactly which ones fit your machine. Additional options focus on the quantity of ink and toner. While page yield will vary based on coverage, paper size and pages per job, it represents the number of estimated pages you can print from a single cartridge based on 5% coverage. Select between options including: Standard - A standard single ink or toner cartridge Multi packs - Multiple standard cartridges bundled for savings and to reduce shopping frequency High Yield - Cartridges that contain more than standard amounts of toner or ink for less frequent replacement For high capacity and refillable ink tank printing, shop the Staples selection of HP Smart Tank printers and get as much as two years' worth of ink with your initial purchase.

The actual number of page yield will vary depending on the toner/ink coverage of the documents, the number of pages per job and the paper size. Page yield is based on an approximate 5% page coverage. ISO page yield is a reliable way to compare products from competing manufacturers, since all tests are subjected to the same set of ISO testing standards. Valid online at staples.com® only.
