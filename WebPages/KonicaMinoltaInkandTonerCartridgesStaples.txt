Cost Efficient Many people believe buying cheap printer cartridges is the best way to save money on supplies. In the long run, genuine Konica Minolta printer cartridges remain the most cost-efficient solution for consumers looking to stock up on dependable yet economical consumables for home or business printing. Once installed in a compatible machine, Konica Minolta cartridges can significantly decrease downtime and improve workplace productivity and efficiency, allowing the production of a range of quality documents with minimum disruption to the workday. Reliable While remanufactured cartridges may significantly lower printing expenses, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) units offer a reliable solution for consumers dealing with high print volumes on a regular basis.

Konica Minolta printer cartridges come in high- and standard-yield versions, which means that users can easily find the type and model cartridge that is best suited to their individual printing needs.

Genuine Konica Minolta cartridges feature a simple design made for easy installation to keep printers up and running. They quickly and cleanly snap into place, limiting the amount of time the machine is out of action.

The actual number of page yield will vary depending on the toner/ink coverage of the documents, the number of pages per job and the paper size. Page yield is based on an approximate 5% page coverage. ISO page yield is a reliable way to compare products from competing manufacturers, since all tests are subjected to the same set of ISO testing standards. 7/16/23 – 7/22/23 50% BIR on TONER & DRUMS Valid online at staples.com® only.
