Whether it's a corporation that goes through reams a day on sales collateral or a family restaurant printing extra menus, businesses of all sizes can benefit from copy paper sold at Staples. How Is Paper Packaged? Paper packaging depends on the type of paper being purchased from Staples. For example, most copy paper typically comes packaged in reams, which is a standard unit containing 500 sheets. If you need many reams, consider buying cartons of copy paper in bulk. Each carton contains a set number of reams. Other types of paper like color paper are sold by the number of sheets per pack. Colored paper sold at Staples typically ranges in size from 250 sheets to 5,000 sheets. Index cards are also available in bulk, but more commonly range from 50 to 100 cards per pack. What Sizes of Paper Are Available? In general, standard paper sizes will vary depending on the type of paper. That’s why the standard sizes for index cards will not be the same as the standard sizes for colored paper or notepads. However, there are four common printer paper sizes throughout North America: junior legal, legal, letter and tabloid. Junior legal size: 8 x 5 inches Legal size: 8.5 x 14 inches Letter size: 8.5 x 11 inches Tabloid size: 11 x 17 inches While letter size is great for both academic and business purposes as well as general use, the legal and junior sizes of paper proliferate the law industry in the form of legal pads. The tabloid size, also known as the ledger size, is used to make small newspapers or tabloids. What Are Common Types of Paper? While copy or printer paper may be what is traditionally thought of when referring to paper, there are a multitude of types of paper and paper-based items available at Staples. In addition to copy or printer paper, there is also colored paper, cardstock paper, stationery paper, index cards and more. Pair your chosen style of paper with our selection of office supplies to come up with creative projects. Are All Types of Paper Recyclable? Yes and no. Most kinds of paper are recyclable, but there are some exceptions. Fresh paper and paper with ink or pencil markings are safe to recycle, however once papers come into contact with paint, they are no longer recyclable. Most colored paper is recyclable, but some isn’t. A quick way to be sure is to tear off a corner and see if it is white in the middle. If so, recycle it! If not, toss it in the garbage to be safe or contact your local recycling center to learn more. Which paper is not recyclable no matter its condition? Do not recycle: Paper with any sticky adhesive Paper that has been shredded, as the fibers are too short for the recycling process Any type of wax paper As always, be sure to check with your local waste management authorities prior to recycling items you are unsure of.
