To make sure productivity remains high throughout the day, it's important to keep a fully stocked breakroom or office kitchen with supplies for employees, staff and customers to refuel. Shop a wide range of office breakroom supplies like coffee, water and snacks here on the Staples website. Learn more below. What Are Breakroom Supplies? Keeping breakroom supplies well-stocked in the office or workplace can go a long way in physically and mentally energizing employees. Having sustenance on hand can help keep employees going and prevent that afternoon slump. It’s typical to have a coffee station filled with everything needed to make the perfect cup, including a coffee maker, coffee, milk, creamer, sugars and sweeteners. Most breakrooms also include the necessary paper products, like filters, stirrers and straws. Many workplace breakrooms also offer some variety of water, sodas, teas, juices or energy drinks, as well as pick-me-up snacks, such as crackers, chips or granola bars. Why Buy Office Breakroom Supplies? Keeping office breakroom supplies in stock is an easy way to establish a happy workplace. Providing these creature comforts shows employees that they matter and that you want them to feel their best at work. When employees feel valued — and when they’re well hydrated and fed — they’re more productive and the quality of their work improves. What Do You Put in a Breakroom? There aren’t any rules for what must go in a workplace breakroom, other than it’s a good idea to have furniture like tables and chairs. A good rule of thumb is to maintain a variety of food and beverages so there’s something for everyone to enjoy. Having a good balance of healthy and sweet or savory treats is a good way to go. Also keep in mind allergies and ensure these employees have a snack they can consume. Be sure to label breakroom supplies that could cause an allergic reaction as well. Don’t forget supporting supplies like creamer, cups, plates and cutlery. Depending on whether your breakroom has a kitchen, you may want to consider kitchen organization supplies. If your breakroom does have a kitchen, stock it with common kitchen supplies like a paring knife, cutting board or kitchen towels. What Are Healthy Snacks for the Breakroom? Healthy snacks include foods made with natural ingredients that are high in protein or fiber to keep employees sustained throughout the day. This could include items like protein bars, nuts, fruits or yogurts. Providing drinking water is a great way to encourage people to stay properly hydrated without overdoing it on sugar.
